# 'acc' or 'accuracy'
Notebooks for learning deep learning
# I see a lot of confusion relation to using 'acc' or 'accuracy' here. 
# Apparently tf 2.5.0 supports 'acc' while tf 2.6.0 supports 'accuracy'
# Since the jupyter notebooks used in the course run on 2.5.0, dated 19-09-2021, clearly 'acc' will help you run the right code there!
