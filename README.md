## Course on Tensorflow

In this course, you're going to take a look at training and inference using JavaScripts. This will allow you to take your knowledge of Machine Learning models and use them in the browser as well as on backend servers like Node.js. We're going to start in the browser, and this week you're going to build some basic models using JavaScript, and you'll execute them in a simple web page.
