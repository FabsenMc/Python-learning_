The representations downstream start highlighting what the network pays attention to, and they show fewer and fewer features being \"activated\"; most are set to zero. This is called \"sparsity.\" Representation sparsity is a key feature of deep learning.\n\n\nThese representations carry increasingly less information about the original pixels of the image, but increasingly refined information about the class of the image. You can think of a convnet (or a deep network in general) as an information distillation pipeline."
